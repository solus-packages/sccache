summary    : ccache with cloud storage for C/C++/Rust
description: |
    sccache is a ccache-like compiler caching tool. It is used as a compiler wrapper and avoids compilation when possible, storing cached results either on local disk or in one of several cloud storage backends. It includes support for caching the compilation of C/C++ code, Rust, as well as NVIDIA's CUDA using nvcc.
